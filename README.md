# **MadLibs Generate Story**

It is a simple app that had 4 input box that will accept Noun, secondNoun, Adjective and a Color.
It will generate a very short story by combining the user inputs and I have some arrays of phrases like, Settings, Actions and Characters.
I have a loop that will randomly select the phrases from those array and by combining user inputs and my random phrases it will generate a short story.
